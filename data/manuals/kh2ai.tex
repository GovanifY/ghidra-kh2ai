Blabla 
It is also worthy to note that some operations that otherwise do the same thing
are given a different mnemonic depending on the context to be easier to write an
assembler. An example of this can be seen in the PUSH.V and PUSH.L operations,
which, while they both push a value to the stack, one of them is 48bits long and
pushes a raw value while the other is 32bits long and does a relocation on the
encoded address before pushing it, making the different naming needed.

\section{Instruction Format of Each Instruction} 
The description of each instruction uses the following format. 

\section{Mnemonic}
Page headings show the instruction mnemonic and a brief description of the function, and the MIPS architecture level.
\section{Instruction Encoding} 
This picture illustrates the bit formats of an instruction word. 
\section{Format}

\Chapter{System Calls}

\section{Introduction}
What is a system call blabla.
None of them are currently documented, they are available at address 0x0034dd00
of SLPM\_666.75,  and there is 738 elements if I'm not mistaken. Either try to
guess their arguments 


\Chapter{Known issues}
As this is very much a work-in-progress project, much of the ISA has yet to
stabilize before getting a stable documentation and some issues still exist. You
will find below some of those.

\section{Notable amount of undocumented instructions}
While the disassemblers knows the size of all instructions and is able to get a
complete unbroken output, some functions are still partly or fully unknown and
as such cannot be assembled yet, nor are they understood by the decompiler. Such
instructions will most likely have "unk" in their name.

\section{syscalls function pointers breaks X-Refs}
Sometimes, syscalls take for arguments function pointers. An analyzer has been
created to be able to analyze this specific case but I have been unable to find
a way to get a similar instruction but resolving the relocation without breaking
the assembler.
As such pointers are written down as comments next to the instruction. You would
have to use those to verify X-Refs until a better solution is found.
